# Introduction
This repository is an implementation of the paper [ForensicsForest Family: A Series of Multi-scale Hierarchical Cascade Forests for Detecting GAN-generated Faces](https://arxiv.longhoe.net/abs/2308.00964) presented in TIFS 2024. This paper describes ForensicsForest Family, a novel set of forest-based methods to detect GAN-generate faces. In contrast to the recent efforts of using CNNs, we investigate the feasibility of using forest models and introduce a series of multi-scale hierarchical cascade forests, which are ForensicsForest, Hybrid ForensicsForest, and Divide-and-Conquer ForensicsForest, respectively.

# ForensicsForest

## **Requirements**
```
python 3.7
numpy
pandas
deep-forest 0.1.7
dlib 19.24.0
scikit-learn 1.0.2
matplotlib
opency-python
xgboost 1.6.2
torch 1.13.1
torchvision 0.14.1
```
## Dataset Preparation

We include the dataset loaders for several commonly-used generated-faces datasets, i.e.,  [StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) ,  [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) , and  [StyleGAN3](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3) . You can enter the dataset website to download the original data. The folder structure is shown as following.

```ruby
StyleGAN
|---train
    |---0
    |---1
|---test
    |---0
    |---1
|---train.csv
|---test.csv
```
To obtain the CSV file of the dataset, run the following script in your console.

```
run get_csv.py
     --dataset_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/train/ \
     --save_csv_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/train.csv
```

## Input Feature Extract
We use four scales as N = 1, 2, 3, 4. Then we can extract appearance and frequency features from N(N â‰¥ 1) patches of input images. Specially, we extract biology features from the whole
image. You can extract the input features for each scale using `extract_feature.py` as following.(Our code uses N=4 as an example).

```
run extract_feature.py
    --m 2  \
    --n 2  \
    --detector_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat  \
    --read_path  /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/train/0/  \
    --save_patch_path  /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/N=4/patch/train/0/  \
    --save_feature_path1 /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/N=4/train/0/hist/  \
    --save_feature_path2 /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/N=4/train/0/spec/  \
    --save_feature_path3 /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/N=4/train/0/landmarks/  \
    --save_feature_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/N=4/train/0/
```

Note that `extract_feature.py` is only for the folder corresponding to the generated faces, you can modify the file path to extract the input features of the real faces, and then use `merge.py` to concatenate the extracted features as following.

```
run merge.py
    --train_feature_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/N=4/train/  \
    --test_feature_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/N=4/test/  \
    --save_path  /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/N=4/
```

## Hierarchical Cascade Forest

For the `cascade.py` of package *deep-forest*, you can replace it with `ForensicsForest cascade.py`.

## Multi-scale Ensemble

Run `main2.py`, `main3.py` and `main4.py` respectively to obtain the augmented features of each sacle as following.

```
run main2.py --dataset_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/
```
```
run main3.py --dataset_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/
```
```
run main4.py --dataset_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/
```

Then run `main1.py` for final results as following.

```
run main1.py --dataset_path /media/ForensicsForest-main/StyleGAN/
```

**Notice:** For Hybrid ForensicsForest and Divide-and-Conquer ForensicsForest, you just need to change Module *Hierarchical Cascade Forest* as following.

# Hybrid ForensicsForest

For the `cascade.py` of package *deep-forest*, you can replace it with `Hybrid FF cascade.py`.

# Divide-and-Conquer ForensicsForest

For the `cascade.py` of package *deep-forest*, you can replace it with `D-and-C FF cascade.py`. For the `layer.py` of package *deep-forest*, you can replace it with `D-and-C FF layer.py`.
